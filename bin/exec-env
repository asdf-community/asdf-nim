# on M1 Macs. On M1, Homebrew lives in /opt/homebrew instead of /usr/local.
# So end users have to put something like DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
# in their shell init files. However, macOS has a security feature called SIP
# which prevents certain env vars such as DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH from propagating
# to /usr/bin/env child processes. So, we assume that if the user is on M1 macOS
# and has Homebrew installed, they want to link to libraries there. To skip this
# set ASDF_NIM_MACOS_M1_HOMEBREW_WORKAROUND=no in your environment.
